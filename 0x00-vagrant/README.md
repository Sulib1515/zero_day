I'm overwhelmed for having this opportunity of learning software engineering and
 i'm grateful to alx program and their teams for making the experience possible.
I honestly don't have any idea about vi, emacs, vagrant, virtual box/machine bef
ore but now i'm gradually getting to know them and how to use them better and i
promise to make alx proud for what they are doing by putting all my best to aqui
re it and make use of it to better my enviroment and the world at large.
