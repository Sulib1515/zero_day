This is my first Readme file markdown messaged after successfuly installing VM,
I'm overwhelmed for having this opportunity of learning software engineering and i'm grateful to alx program and their teams for making the experence possible.
I honestly don't have any idea about vi, emacs, vagrant, virtual box/machine before but now i'm gradually getting to know them and how to use them better and i promise to make alx proud for what they are doing by putting all my best to aquire it and make use of it to better enviroment and the world at large.
